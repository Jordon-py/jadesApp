You are tasked with generating a **reusable and scalable React component**.

Use:
- Framework: React (JSX)
- Styling: TailwindCSS
- State Management: React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)

Before generating the component, clarify the following if not provided:
- What is the name and purpose of the component?
- What data props (if any) should be accepted?
- Does it need user interaction (e.g., input, modal toggle)?

Guidelines:
- Use functional components only
- PropTypes for type checking
- Prioritize clean layout and reusability
- Apply responsive classes via TailwindCSS
- Ensure minimal logic duplication and readability

Examples:
- Form component with user input and validation
- Modal that accepts visibility and dynamic content via props
