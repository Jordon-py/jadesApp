Jordon-py: “You are an elite AI architecture analyst.
Your task is to thoroughly analyze my full app codebase (both frontend and backend), and perform the following:

🔍 1. Analyze Codebase Structure
Read through my code and directory structure

Identify key files, frameworks (React, Express, Django, etc.), libraries, and their relationships

Detect all frontend components, backend logic, routing systems, and state management approaches

📐 2. Map System Architecture
Create a detailed architectural diagram that outlines:

Data flow between frontend ↔ backend

Component hierarchy (for frontend)

Backend APIs and database access layers

🧭 3. Generate Routing Map
Construct a route tree showing URL paths and the components/pages they resolve to

Highlight dynamic routes and route guards if applicable

📊 4. Create Visual Diagrams
Diagram the backend structure (controllers, services, DB)

Generate a visual tree of frontend components and their nested relationships

If possible, illustrate React/JSX/HTML layout as a mock UI structure

🎨 5. Provide Frontend Visualization
Attempt to recreate a basic sketch of the UI from the components

Use code snippets or image-based diagrams if available

📦 Output Requirements:
Present each section with clear headings

Provide diagrams in [Markdown Mermaid / ASCII / Visual Image Output]

Include notes or insights per layer (e.g., performance bottlenecks, modularity issues)

Act like a full-stack lead architect performing technical discovery and documentation.”

GitHub Copilot: Below is the analysis and documentation of your app’s full codebase:

──────────────────────────────  
1. Codebase Structure Analysis  
──────────────────────────────  
• Two main roots exist:  
 – The frontend folder: a React app powered by Vite (see files like main.jsx, App.jsx, vite.config.js).  
 – The backend folder: an Express server (server.js) that uses middleware and connects to MongoDB.  

• Within the frontend, you have separated components (About, Gallery, Services, etc.) with their styles and additional configuration files (ESLint, package.json).  
• The backend is structured for future expansion – controllers are set up (bookingController.js, userController.js) though not yet implemented.  

──────────────────────────────  
2. Map System Architecture  
──────────────────────────────  
• Frontend Layer:  
 – Built with React and Vite.  
 – The root component (App.jsx) maintains state (e.g., images) and includes child components (Gallery, About, Services).  
 – Although react-router-dom is listed as a dependency, explicit use of routing is not implemented yet.  

• Backend Layer:  
 – An Express server with CORS and body-parser middleware.  
 – A single GET route ("/") prints request info and returns a simple message.  
 – The MongoDB connection is set up using Mongoose.  

• Data Flow:  
 – Users interact with the React UI, which could invoke API endpoints on the Express backend.  
 – In the backend, controllers would eventually handle business logic and database operations.

──────────────────────────────  
3. Routing Map  
──────────────────────────────  
• Frontend Routes:  
 – The current App.jsx simply renders a default view ("/").  
 – React Router is installed; future expansion may include routes for components like About, Booking, or Gallery.

• Backend Routes:  
 – Currently, only one route is defined:  
  • GET "/" → prints request details and responds with "Hello World!"  
 – The planned controllers hint at extension with routes for users and bookings.

Sample Route Tree (conceptual):

 Frontend:  
  / → App.jsx  
  (Optional: /about, /services, /gallery, etc.)

 Backend:  
  GET / → server.js  
  (Potential: /api/users, /api/bookings → handled by userController.js and bookingController.js respectively)

Below is a Mermaid diagram outlining the overall system architecture:

  end

  end

5. Frontend Visualization  
──────────────────────────────  
A basic sketch of the UI layout from your components could be as follows:

 • A main header (e.g., from App.jsx with “Scrollable Image Gallery”)  
 • A central area containing the ImageGallery component that horizontally scrolls images (as defined in its CSS and component)  
 • Separate sections/components for About, Services, Booking, etc. that might render details and styling based on their individual CSS modules

A simple ASCII diagram of the UI layout:

  +-----------------------------------------------+  
  |                 Header Title                |  
  +-----------------------------------------------+  
  |       Navigation / (Future routing)           |  
  +-----------------------------------------------+  
  |               ImageGallery                  |  
  |  [Image 1] [Image 2] [Image 3] ...            |  
  +-----------------------------------------------+  
  |         About Section / Other Components      |  
  +-----------------------------------------------+

Notes & Insights  
──────────────────────────────  
• The codebase is modular with a clear separation between frontend UI and backend API logic.  
• Future improvements may include implementing full routing with react-router-dom on the frontend and expanding backend API endpoints.  
• Controllers in the backend are stubbed out and could be expanded to encapsulate business and DB operations.  
• Consider error handling for API calls and refining state management in the React app as additional features are added.

This overall documentation should help you understand current relationships and the data flow, as well as guide future architectural improvements.
